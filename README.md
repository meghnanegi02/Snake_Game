# Snake_Game
<br>
This is a simple console-based Snake Game implemented in C++ using the Windows API for keyboard input and screen clearing. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The objective is to achieve the highest score without colliding with the boundaries or the snake's own body.
